## How it works

The stopwatch counts up to 99 before eventually overflowing and going to 0, additionally, there is a 10 second mode that can be activated to increment by 1 every 10 seconds

## How to test

The design allows for you to start, stop, pause, and run at 10 second increments for input. To test, check if you can go to 99 with 1 second increments, pausing and starting, then try it with 10.

## External hardware

Two 7-segment displays for the tens and ones place, and 4 buttons for a one's button, one for a ten's button, one for a pause, and one for a clear.
